                        designer based out of Scotch Plains, NJ. <span class="bold"> I’ve always had a heart for my
                            local community and
                            believe in supporting local and small businesses. </span>I’ve been fortunate enough to grow
                        up in a
                        household who values
                        entrepreneurship and owning your own business. Growing up, I’ve seen how my parents had to cut
                        corners and sacrifice on various services due to owning a small business. It’s not always easy
                        competing with some of the bigger names in your industry or community.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph-small">Unfortunately during the 2020
                        pandemic, small businesses are being hit the hardest. I have found a lot of small businesses
                        cannot afford a
                        custom
                        website that is built with their business model in mind. Especially in this pandemic, having a
                        website is more important than ever before. But with the average website costing $2,500+, it’s
                        hard to justify that kind of investment upfront.
                        That’s why I believe in the $0 down, $150 a month business model. <span class="bold"> You’ll get
                            a custom built,
                            tailored design for your business, with UNLIMITED updates, for a manageable
                            cost.</span>

                <p class="paragraph-large paragraph-large__primary bold">What am I exactly paying for?
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-large paragraph-large-primary">You're paying for a personal web designer/developer
                    who is carefully looking after your site and ensuring it's running to it's fullest potential, making
                    you more money. My services include building you a custom site that is built specifically for your
                    business, having me on-call to make any minor changes to your website at any time, hosting your
                    site, as well as constant updates with new web standards. </p>
                <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
                <p class="paragraph-large paragraph-large__primary bold">Why are "hand-coded" sites superior to page
                    builders such as Wix, Squarespace, etc.?
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-large paragraph-large-primary">When you hand-code a site, it runs exactly how you
                    want it to run. There is no extra code that bloats up your website, making it run slower. Websites
                    built by hand will out-perform most Wordpress sites and drag and drop page builders. The more
                    organized your code is, the faster your site will run. We diligently write line by line of code to
                    ensure your site if running to it's fullest potential. </p>
                <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
                <p class="paragraph-large paragraph-large__primary bold">When do you mean by "unlimited customizations"?
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-large paragraph-large-primary">If you need to update your hours, messaging, add new
                    images, etc., we can do that for you! Maybe you're a restaurant and want to update your weekly menu,
                    we can do that! Maybe you're a contractor and want to add more services on your site, we can do
                    that. We hold the right to deny any customizations that are outside the scope outlined prior to
                    beginning your site.</p>
                <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
                <p class="paragraph-large paragraph-large__primary bold">What do you need from me to get my site up and
                    running?
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-large paragraph-large-primary">All we need from you is whatever content you may need
                    for your site. A typical 5 page website includes your home page, an about page, services, portfolio
                    (or gallery/images), and a contact page. If you want to swap out one of those pages for something
                    else you have in mind, we can work with you. We will also ask for your logo and any type/color
                    preferences. If you would like to give your company a fresh look with an updated logo and identity,
                    let us know. </p>
                <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
                <p class="paragraph-large paragraph-large__primary bold">What happen if I cancel?
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-large paragraph-large-primary">Not happy with our services? Not a problem! You can
                    cancel at any time. Once you cancel, your site will be down unless you resume our services again.
                    You get to keep your domain (the url) and your content (the information living on your website). If
                    you would like to keep your website after cancelling, you can purchase the design & code from me for
                    a one-time fee.</p>
                <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
                <p class="paragraph-large paragraph-large__primary bold">Whats the catch?
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-large paragraph-large-primary">There is no catch! When I say I care about our local
                    community and small businesses, I really do mean it. Once you sign the contract and pay for the
                    first month, I get to work and build a custom site for you. Your site should be ready in about 2
                    weeks, once I receive all the content from you. </p>
